### What is this?

The Exploit is part of Pusher, a jailbreak for iPhoneOS 2.x developed by Ripdev. 
This exploit, or a variant of it was used in other more familair jailbreak tools at the time, such as Pwnagetool.
Some parts of the jailbreak itself are also included. In the future, the entire jailbreak will likey be open sourced, including the interface code. For the moment though, enjoy this =) 

### Why open source it now?

Open sourced for purposes of educating & aiding development of new jailbreaks for legacy iOS versions.

More projects will be open sourced soon, stay tuned!


До скорой встречи ;)
